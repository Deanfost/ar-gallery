# ar-video
A slightly impractical way of watching video on Android with AR Core. 

## Overview
This application uses Google's AR Core in conjunction with the Sceneform library to play on-device video as 2D Renderables on real-world surfaces. Transport controls are displayed as UI elements on the device screen, while video is displayed on the Renderable. You can resize the "screen" as large as the attached surface allows. 

## Requirements
This application requires that Google AR Core is installed on device. As a result, the minimum API level is API 24 (Android 7.0 Nougat). Other than that, all you really need is some video and a camera.

## Libraries and Resources
* [Google AR Core](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/) 
* [Sceneform Library](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/sceneform/)

## Builds
Release build coming soon!
