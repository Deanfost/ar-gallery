An impractical way to look at photos on Android with AR Core. 

## Overview
This application uses Google's AR Core in conjunction with the Sceneform Library to show on-device images in the world space. Upon choosing an image, the user can place their image on discovered planes and view them with the camera. If the user taps on the image, a second node will appear that displays metadata about the image, including filename, date of modification, file resolution, file size, and geolocation if available.

To use this application, your device must support API Level 24 (Android 7.0 Nougat) or above, and have Google AR Core installed.
